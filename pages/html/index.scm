  {p
   Hi, I'm Jack Faller. (As you may have surmised from title of this page.)
   I'm primarily a programmer.
   I've been doing it for some years now and I like to think I'm rather good at it.
   This is the place I will be collating and writing about the things I've done (programming or otherwise), and sharing my general musings on life.
   I have been cursed with a great many ideas and I hope they may be of some use to you.}
  {p
   Check out {{a {href /blogroll.xml}} my blogroll} to see who I follow.}
