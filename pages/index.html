<h2>About Me and This Site</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Jack Faller! (As you may have surmised from title of this page.) I've
  been programming for a few years now, and doing some other things too. Now
  I've decided to upload some of those things to the internet, and a major
  location for that is this site. I have too many ideas to keep them all to
  myself, so I hope you can get something from the ones I put here.
