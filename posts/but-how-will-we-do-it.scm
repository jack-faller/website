} {description I recently saw a discussion around the idea of banning advertising, and the tired old complaint came up: {q how will we define what advertising is?} And then {q you want the government to decide what counts as advertising!?} I'm sick and tired of it. Yes, the government can decide what a thing is. They can categorise a thing in a useful way and ban it. That is their job. And then courts can determine which things meet that criteria and so apply that law fairly. That is the function of the court system. People seem to act as if giving the government any power to enforce laws on any matter will inevitably lead to horrible consequences. It won't. We can ask politicians to figure out how to regulate things and then courts will fairly determine the things to which that regulation applies. That's how the system works, and if it has stopped working, you have much greater issues than the laws which you want being enacted in a flawed way.}}
