{{thought {version #1}} {title New Wonka Has No Bite} {published #"2023/09/08 12:44 +0100"} {uuid a4e1bee8-a0ad-4785-bcc2-788408122007
} {description I'm sure you've at least been exposed to the saltest in a sudden flurry of one-word-title-that's-the-name-of-the-main-character movies – {{a {href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg}} Wonka}. No offence to Timothée Chalamet, but I don't like it. Gene Wilder's Wonka was a lying child-endangering nutter who who took people on {{a {href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB401RfGMlM}} mad psychedelic boat rides with giant insects while screaming at them}. Depp's was perhaps more deranged (for better or worse). I don't think Chalamet will have any scenes with this kind of bite, and all that's left behind will be a sickly-sweet feel-good movie with little actual substance.}}
