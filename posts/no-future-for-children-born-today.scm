 "No Future for Children Born Today"
 "2023/09/04 17:52 +0100"
 {just
  Kids these days have no plans for the future.
  I know that sounds like a {q kids these days}-ism, but I think there 's some truth to it.}
 {p
  Ask a lot of young people these days what their life plans are, and you won't get much back.
  Most of the people I've talked to about this haven't really had any beyond finishing school.
  A surprising number involved suicide at that point (as a joke, obviously, but it does highlight that these people don't expect much to happen after that).
  It would be easy to chock this up to kids not planning for things because they're young and stupid.
  Partly true I'm sure.
  Climate change doomerism is another easy suspect.
  I don't doubt that hearing the world will end soon has an effect on your ability to plan for the future.
  But I think there is something worse going on.}

 {p
  Consider the traditional life plan:
  {ol
   {li Go to school.}
   {li Get a job.}
   {li Get married.}
   {li Buy a house.}
   {li Have children.}
   {li Retire.}
   {li Die.}}
  School and death aren't particularly hard, but a lot of the other things on that list are much more difficult now.
  Getting a job isn't too hard, but it will likely be worse and pay less than people of earlier generations could have managed.
  The institution of marriage has fallen from grace somewhat.
  Marriage is still very frequent but I don't think people today are as concerned about it as they were in the past.
  Buying a house is a dream many have essentially given up on.
  Having children is too expensive for most people, especially those without houses.
  People are retiring later and later every year.}
 {p
  Is it any wonder that people describe their plan as {q go to school then die} when those are two remaining elements of the list?}
 (link-heading 2 "downward-spiral" "Downward Spiral")
 {p
  I think this problem is getting worse.
  An ageing population makes it harder to make money which makes it harder to have kids which makes the population age.
  Making people poorer also decreases consumer spending which has a negative impact on jobs.
  These factors have a kind of negative interferance, they all drive eachother downward.
  China is a prime example here, having jump-started their own decline with the one-child policy.
  The youth of China suffer all of these problems 50-fold.
  It would be wise to watch and see how China reacts to this issue in the coming years and the rest of the world may be following the same path.}
 {p
  The best hope here would be that people are suddenly payed a lot more due to increases in productivity from automation.
  This is the opposite of the current trend, so I wouldn't be holding out.
  In fact, many important metric are trending the wrong way.
  Recent drops in house prices have paradoxically made life harder for renters and made buying a house more difficult due to mortgage costs increasing.
  Loneliness, depression, and suicidality are all up.
  Not a very positive outlook at all.}

 {p
  This is one of the most interesting parts of this mess.
  You would expect a great deal of discontentment from those with their future stolen.
  Perhaps some kind of radical ideology arising to serve the needs of the disenfranchised.
  But instead I see very little happening.
  It seems apathy is all that survives the crushing hopelessness of living without a future.})
