} {description Rapid growth is expected from new businesses, but this will surely lead to failure if they provide quality products that last a long time. If they expand operations to meet the demand while they grow, they will be left with a huge drop off in sales once everyone that wants their product has bought one. For such businesses, slow growth is much more sustainable than fast growth, yet fast growth is effectively demanded from all new businesses.}}
