 {description
  I've heard the advice that one aught not use a slash (/) in formal writing as it is ambiguous whether it means {q and} or {q or}, but I find it works well in cases where either would work.
  In situations such as a {q carpenter/cabinet maker,} both alternations are describing the same person, so that person is both things—conjunction—but equally both activities are not partaken at the same time—thus disjunction.
  The slash therefore has use when describing two mutually exclusive properties of the same subject.
  I think the real source of the complaint is that the slash symbol tends to look rather bad in type setting, for instance in the phrase {q carpenter/cabinet maker}, the slash appears to group {q carpenter/cabinet} where it is actually taking both words after it.
  I think a reasonable solution to this, is to write a {q carpenter slash cabinet maker.}
  While some may find this literal use of punctuation disturbing, I note that the slash is often actively pronounced in speech, and is thus more of an abbreviation, similar to ampersand (&), the recommendation for which is use only in cases where space is limited and not in prose.
  Extending this treatment to slash is only logical.}}
