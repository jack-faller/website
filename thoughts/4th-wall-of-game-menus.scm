{{thought {version #1}} {title 4th Wall of Game Menus} {published #"2023/09/14 16:43 +0100"} {uuid e748c02c-f8db-4a91-a27f-93ccd1251620
} {description You might consider menus as a sort of 4{sup th} wall of video games. They exist as interface between the world of the game and the physical reality of consoles. It's quite odd then, that many games present these diegetically â€“ as though they actually exist in the world of the game. The {{a {href https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pip-Boy}} Pip Boy} is a good example of this. They player's in-game character will look at a watch-like device on their wrist to access the items they're carrying. It's down-right strange that to get an item out of your backpack you would somehow use a smart watch to select it, but that seems to be the canonical way of doing this in the Fallout games. Another example is MMO menus as seen through Isekai anime. Characters in these shows will often open a stat menu as a strange floating hologram which they take as naturally existing in the world. Games like Undertale can even be observed breaking this 4{sup th} wall when characters from the game interact with the player's menu.}}
