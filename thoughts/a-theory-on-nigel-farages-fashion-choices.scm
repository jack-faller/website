} {description For a long time I've assumed that Nigel Farage dresses in hunting gear to go around counsel estates in some out-of-touch attempt to seem common. {q Poor people all work in the fields, so I better wear my country clothes to look like one of them.} This was my rough approximation of his logic. It occurs to me now that there may be a simpler explanation: He wants to look like a rich person. His goal is to appear as an elite who listens to and loves the lower classes, descending from his opulence to guide them to success. His greatest trick is to make people love their rulers and hate their neighbours.}}
