 "Are There Women on the Internet?"

  I have been using the internet for several years, and I just realised I haven't seen any women on it.
  Obviously part of this is bias.
  I assume I'm talking to men most of the time, so some women might have fallen through.
  But even in a context where I know the gender, the number of women is vanishingly small.
  Out of my 210+ YouTube subscriptions, just two are women (and one of those was a man when I subscribed).
  I wonder if I am a secret misogynist?
  The only other explanation I can come up with is that men and women's interests are just algorithmically different in some way that separates us as groups.})
