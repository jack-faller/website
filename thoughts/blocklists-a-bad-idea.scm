 "Blocklists: a Bad Idea"
 "2024/11/17 00:03 +0000"
 {just
  I've recently read a bit on the moderation of the {{a {href https://bsky.app}} BlueSky} platform, and one particular feature stood out to me: block lists.
  These are user-curated lists of accounts which you can either bulk-block or -mute.
  The first thought I had was {q the creators of those lists sure do have a lot of power}.
  I don't think the people who sign up to the lists do any extensive background checks of the maintainers.
  So essentially random people are being elevated to the status of pseudo-moderators.
  I don't like moderators, or at least those on platforms like Discord.
  When they don't have a concrete set of rules or any accountability, they often abuse their power.
  There's nothing to stop the curator of a block list from adding arbitrary people to the list just on the basis of not liking them.
  The subscribers of said list would have no way to know, because they couldn't see that user's posts.
  Do you want to be in a situation where you're talking to someone with the power to soft-ban you from thousands of accounts, with no clear reason nor chance for appeal?
  If not, then I would suggest you are very cautious in handing this power out to people.})
