 "Faster than Walking but Slower than Running"

  You know when you have a quest to follow an NPC in a video game and they move just faster than your walk speed but slower than your run speed?
  I had always just assumed that was necessary.
  If they moved at just the walk speed it would be too slow and you'd get impatient, but moving at the run speed they might get too far ahead.
  I had always just dismissed this problem as unsolvable until I thought about it for more than 5 seconds and realised you could just have them go at run speed then slow down if they get too far ahead.
  So if any video game makes that mistake in the future, they now have no excuse (aside from it looking a bit odd if everyone runs everywhere).})
