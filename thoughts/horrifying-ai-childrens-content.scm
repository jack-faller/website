 "Horrifying AI Children's Content"

  Having just seen this {{a {href https://youtu.be/1IyALvTlgec}} horrifying AI abomination} advertised to me on YouTube, I'm concerned about the effect of AI on children.
  I think we can all appreciate that brainrot IPad-baby content is probably bad for children in the same way that social media is probably bad for adults, but this seems uniquely harmful.
  I think it's because there might, at some point, be genuinely be no human involvement in these videos at all; just AI feeding children whatever makes them click on it.
  In fact there would be two different AIs at work, training to feed children with the optimally engaging content.
  Channels will use AI models to mass produce colourful nonsense, then the YouTube AI will create a kind of natural selection, causing these channels to evolve into whatever optimally holds the attention of children.
  The result is a phenomenon known as brainrot â€“ content which uses techniques algorithmically developed to retain viewer's attention and nothing else.
  It's probably bad to expose children to this stuff, especially at the scale AI now threatens to.
  There should be some human oversight.})
