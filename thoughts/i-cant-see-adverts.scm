} {description I've gotten this advert on YouTube with some really annoying music in it a lot recently. It only just occurred to me that I don't know what it's for beyond that it has cars in it. I don't think I know what any adverts are for because I've seen so many that my brain just blocks them out. I would guess most people are like this which makes me wonder how adverts make any money at all.}}
