{{thought {version #1}} {title Isn't Privacy a Bit Weird?} {published #"2023/09/03 12:43 +0100"} {uuid 8520f7b3-1bac-4648-bee4-03395a72ad63
} {description I see a lot of people very obsessed with privacy, and I really don't get why.} {body {p A prime example of this would be this guy which basically said: {q Face ID and fingerprint ID are bad because the police can compel you to unlock your phone with those, but not with a password.}. The underlying assumption here is, I think, a common sort of libertarian thought â€“ that the government is going to create unjust laws so you, as an individual, should have the right to break them and not get caught. That's a bad thing to be thinking. It basically assumes that government is evil so we should move to make it impotent as well, that way it can't hurt us. Thinking that there is absolutely no way to fix the government is the end point of political disenfranchisement. It's anti-democracy in the sense that no democracy can function if people view themselves as fundamentally unable to create good government.} {p Don't get me wrong\; I'm not against privacy. I don't think the government should just collect a bunch of data for no reason and I would rather big companies don't know everything about me. But, practically speaking, I've yet to see the benefits of all this mad privacy stuff compared to the effort that goes into it. It's a bit creepy that Mark Zuckerberg knows who my friends are without me creating a Facebook account, but it isn't really doing me any harm. Personally, I don't see the benefit in taking a large number of steps to secure my data in preparation for a police raid on my house.} {p There are a whole bunch of people out there who seem totally obsessed with that. They're willing to spend a lot of money and time, forfeit a lot of personal convenience, just to avoid the possibility of some people knowing relatively innocuous things about them.}}}
