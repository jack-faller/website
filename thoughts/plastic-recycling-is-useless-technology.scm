 "Plastic Recycling Is Useless Technology"

 {just
  There are two possibilities for how society responds to plastic pollution.
  The first is that we continue to produce plastic and destroy the world with it.
  It's impossible to recycle most of that plastic and the recycled stuff eventually becomes waste anyway so plastic recycling doesn't help here.
  The other is that we stop producing plastic.
  Plastic recycling is useless if there is no plastic.
  Either way, these stupid plastic recycling project people come up with are useless.
  They only serve to justify the production of more plastic by pretending it can be recycled and isn't as bad as it is.})
