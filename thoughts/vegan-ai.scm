 "Vegan AI"

 {just
  I've recently seen a lot of discussion around the {{a {href https://openworm.org/}} OpenWorm} project.
  It aims to fully simulate every cell in the body of a certain type of nematode worm.
  Is this program vegan?
  Aught fully simulated animals have the same rights as regular animals?
  I would object to my real cat being killed, but what about turning off a simulation of a cat?
  What about an AI language model?
  I have far more evidence of the latter's is consciousness than I do of my cat's.
  So is it vegan?
  Does anyone care?
  So many questions for which I have no answers.})
