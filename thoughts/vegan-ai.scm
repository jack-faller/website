} {description I've recently seen a lot of discussion around the {{a {href https://openworm.org/}} OpenWorm} project. It aims to fully simulate every cell in the body of a certain type of nematode worm. Is this program vegan? Aught fully simulated animals have the same rights as regular animals? I would object to my real cat being killed, but what about turning off a simulation of a cat? What about an AI language model? I have far more evidence of the latter's is consciousness than I do of my cat's. So is it vegan? Does anyone care? So many questions for which I have no answers.}}
