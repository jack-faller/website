 "We Are Governed by Fools"

  I've been looking at a lot of the stuff coming out of the Starmer government, and I have to say it looks stupider by the minute.
  I used to think there was a kind of logic to Starmer's policies, but now I can't possibly interpret what that could be and I'm confident they won't try to explain it.
  Beyond that, his optics are awful.
  This is the man who had people {{a {href https://www.youtube.com/watch/FO3Efa3OFco}} laughing at him} during the election.
  His understanding of optics is clearly limited.
  But this is not just him\; there is an entire team which has allowed this shambles to proceed.
  Many people would have had to review the idea to cut the winter fuel payment and they collectively decided it was a good idea.
  I can only assume these are whatever talentless dregs were left over after they knifed Corbyn in the back.
  They seem to have about as much understanding of actual governance as they do of optics.
  But then I think back to Sunak, and he seemed much the sameâ€”desperately flailing around in the hopes something good would happen and people would like him.
  Then Truss, Johnson, May, Cameron\; few of these people demonstrated any kind of understanding of the systems of government.
  The decline in the quality of politicians is as stark as it is concerning.
  Is there anyone in this country who's fit to lead it?})
